# PUSH SWAP

## Overview
**`push_swap`** is a project from the 42 curriculum that involves sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and aiming for the smallest number of moves. The goal is to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

## Introduction

The `push_swap` project challenges you to implement an algorithm to sort a stack efficiently using a minimal number of moves. The project emphasizes problem-solving skills, algorithmic efficiency, and an understanding of data structures.

## Features

- Sorts data on a stack.
- Utilizes a limited set of instructions for stack manipulation.
- Aims to achieve the smallest number of moves for optimized sorting.

## Usage

To use `push_swap`:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/aelmaar/Push-Swap.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Build the **push_swap** program using `make` or `make bonus` for **checker** program
5. Run the program with a list of integers as arguments: (e.g: `./push_swap 3 2 1`)
6. Optionally, you can check if the stack is sorted or not: (e.g: `./push_swap 3 2 1 | ./checker 3 2 1`)
